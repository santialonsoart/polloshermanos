## What would be ideal for "Los Pollos Hermanos" to have on its website? (optional)

- [ ] People don't want tricks! They want to know what their food is going to cost them. It would be ideal to have a simple "menu" calculator that allows customers to modify the quantities of these products. **Keep in mind that 21% VAT is applied to all products and that just this month there is a 20% discount on milkshakes**!

| Price by unit | Product         |
|---------------|---------------- |
| 10.00 $       | Chicken Burger |
| 9.00 $        | Chicken Wings   |
| 12.00 $       | French Fries    |
| 8.00 $        | Fried Chicken   |
| 2.20 $        | Beer            |
| 1.80 $        | Milkshake       |

> For example, if the customer wants to order x2 Chicken Burger, x1 French Fries, x2 beers and x1 Milkshake the calculator should show: 
> 
>**PRICE: 45.78 €**. 

- [ ] The map section is an embedded iframe, it's functional but a bit clunky. It would be great to have a map from Google Maps and configured via their API (This would even allow us to style the map in our business colors! Isn't that exciting?)
